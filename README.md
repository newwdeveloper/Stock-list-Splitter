# Stock-list-Splitter
Managing stock lists for TradingView is tedious due to its 30-stock limit per group. The Stock-List Splitter automates this by organizing your Excel data into ready-to-use groups of 30 stocks. Upload your file, copy preformatted groups, and paste directly into TradingViewâ€”saving time, reducing errors, and simplifying your workflow

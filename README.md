Stock-List Splitter: Simplify Your TradingView Workflow

Managing stock lists for TradingView can be a challenging and time-consuming task. TradingView enforces a maximum limit of 30 stocks per group, which makes it difficult for traders to manually organize and sort larger stock lists into these smaller chunks.

The Stock-List Splitter is designed to solve this problem efficiently by automating the organization of your stock data into ready-to-use groups. This tool eliminates the need for manual effort, saving time and reducing errors.

Here’s how it works:

Upload Your Stock Data: Simply upload your Excel file containing the stock data. The tool processes the file to extract the relevant stock symbols from a specific column.
Automated Sorting and Grouping: The extracted stock symbols are automatically grouped into batches of 30 stocks, adhering to TradingView's requirements. Each group is formatted and prepared for easy use.
Ready-Made Groups: The tool generates a neatly organized list for each group of 30 stocks, displaying them in a user-friendly interface. Each group comes with a copy button, allowing you to instantly copy the list.
Seamless Integration: With just a single click, you can copy the prepared list and paste it directly into TradingView. There’s no need for additional editing or formatting.
This user-friendly tool significantly reduces the time required to manage stock lists and ensures that traders can focus more on analysis rather than tedious data preparation. By automating the grouping process, it minimizes human errors and makes the workflow more efficient.

Whether you’re managing hundreds of stocks or just a few, the Stock-List Splitter is the ultimate solution for preparing TradingView-compatible stock lists. Upload, copy, and paste—it’s that simple! Now, organizing your stock data for TradingView has never been easier.
